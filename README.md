This is a basic Snake game developed in Python.
The Project has four files:
  1. main.py
  2. food.py - Has code for the snake food which when eaten is generated at a random place.
  3. snake.py - Has code for the body of the snake and it's movement.
  4. score.py - Has code for maintaining the score of the player.

Comments have been placed in the files for better understanding and readability.
